# Data-Cleaning-With-Python

🔹**Introducing:** 
Finding and correcting mistakes in raw data to make it accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready is known as data cleaning.

🔹**Why Is Data Cleaning Vital:**
Clean data guarantees trustworthy insights, increases analysis accuracy, and averts poor business judgments.

🔹**Types of Issues with Unprocessed Data:**
Missing numbers, duplicates, wrong data types, inconsistent formats, and outliers can all be found in raw data.

🔹**A Comprehensive Guide to Determining Data Issues :**
Exploratory analysis, which includes examining null values, data kinds, duplicates, and summary statistics, is used to find data problems.

🔹**Handling Missing Values:**
Removing rows or columns or filling them with mean, median, mode, or forward/backward fill are two ways to deal with missing values.

🔹**Resolving Inconsistent Formatting:**
By standardizing formats utilizing string and datetime operations, inconsistent data (case, date format, text spacing) is resolved.

🔹**Addressing Duplicates:**
To prevent redundant data and erroneous analysis, duplicate records are found and eliminated.

🔹 **Configuring Data Types :**
For accurate analysis, incorrect data types are transformed into the necessary forms (such as string to date or float to integer).

🔹 **Managing Outliers :**
Statistical techniques like IQR and Z-score are used to deal with outliers, which are extreme results that skew analysis.
